 In this assignment, I have used a simple Superstore Dataset supplied by Tableau.
The dataset is for the Sales of multiple products sold by a company along with subsequent information related to geography, Product categories, and subcategories, sales, and profits, segmentation amongst the consumers, etc.

Sheet1: shows a map of the united states along with the provinces and each province shows (sales and profit).

Sheet2: shows (sales and profit) based on the products(Furniture, office supplies, Technology).

Sheet3:  shows (the number of orders and sales) based on the months(Furniture, office supplies, Technology).
